"""Pinned toolchain versions, and the loud check that they still hold.

GENERIC CORE, unmodified in spirit from the reference implementation this
package was distilled from -- toolchain pin/drift checking has no
block-specific content by name. A PDK's device model set (identified by its
own install-revision marker, e.g. an ``open_pdks`` hash for volare-installed
PDKs) **is** the model data every measured value is taken against; a run
against a different revision produces numbers that are silently
incomparable with every other record under ``sim/``. So the pins recorded in
``sim/toolchain.json`` are checked *before* any point is simulated:

- **pdk_version** -- exact match against whatever :meth:`pdk.Pdk.version`
  reports (an ``open_pdks`` hash for volare/ciel installs; ``"unknown"`` for
  a PDK install that records no revision, which is itself reported as a
  drift).
- **ngspice_min_major** -- a floor, not an exact match. Newer is allowed
  (and recorded); older is refused.
- **python_min** -- a floor.

A drift is fatal by default -- the CLI should refuse to simulate rather than
record a partial or incomparable result -- with an explicit
``--allow-toolchain-drift`` override for the deliberate case (validating the
repo against a newer PDK), which must be recorded verbatim in the record's
Environment section so a drifted record can never be mistaken for a pinned
one.

EXTENSION POINT: none expected. Add a new pin key here only if a future
block genuinely needs to pin something beyond PDK/ngspice/python (e.g. an
extraction tool version for post-layout records) -- that is a core change,
not a per-block one, since every block sharing this template benefits from
it identically.
